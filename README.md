This is a repository of some HTML-CSS projects that I made

 - "html-css-mockup-assignment/"

     -- using a mockup of a webpage, recreate the CSS style, given the HTML content

 - "portfolio-website/"

     -- create the HTML content and the CSS style for a portfolio website

     -- there should be an "About" page and a "Portfolio" page
